This is all the scripts used to carry out the analysis done for the thesis 'Fine mapping of a QTL on chr 23 for white markings in Scandinavian Fjord horses' submitted July 2022.
The scripts are accompanied by an excel sheet 'workflow' that lists the order the scripts should be implemented in. In addition each step includes the input files needed, the files produced by that step, whether multiQC was done on that step and any additional notes. 
Input files, or accessory files such as reference sequences or text files giving regions or additional information are not included. 
The files are all for my specific data so file names will need to be changed in each of the scripts and some parts may need to be unhashed. Basically use caution when using the scripts and expect errors lol.
